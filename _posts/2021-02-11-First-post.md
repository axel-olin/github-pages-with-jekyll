# First blog post

This is a first blog post that I'm writing as part of a github course to create
your own page for one of your repos. I'm not planning to write a lot now, and I
probably won't keep up writing a blog on this page. Even if I would, I would
likely delete this post in order to have a more interesting text as my first blog
post. I'll let this stand for now and I might go back and edit later.
